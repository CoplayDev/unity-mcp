### 'No Unity Instances Found' Message
🚨🚨**When in doubt, restart your client🚨🚨**
- Clients like Claude Code or JetBrains Rider can get confused if you switch from `http` to `stdio` or vice versa.  If they're saying "No Unity Instances found" or similar, make sure you restart the client so it can pick up the new configuration.

### Recommended: Use HTTP Mode (v8+)

**Starting with v8, HTTP mode is the recommended configuration** for Cursor, VSCode, and Windsurf. It's simpler and more reliable than stdio mode.

**Benefits of HTTP mode:**
- No Python/uv installation required for basic usage
- Works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Avoids PATH and environment variable issues
- Server runs independently of the MCP client

**How to use HTTP mode:**
1. In Unity: `Window > MCP for Unity`
2. Click **Start Server** (launches HTTP server on `localhost:8080`)
3. Select your MCP Client and click **Configure**
4. Your client config will use `"url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp"`

If HTTP mode works for you, you can skip the stdio/uv setup below! Only follow the uv installation steps if you specifically need stdio mode.

### Install/Repair uv and Python (For stdio mode - Optional)

The key to configuring MCP with **Cursor, Windsurf, and VSCode is `uv`.**

- `uv` is a fast Python package manager we use to create a self-sufficient python server for the MCP, which runs `server.py`.
- **How it's used**: your MCP client config points to `command: uv` with args like `--directory <UnityMcpServer/src> run server.py`. The client will invoke uv directly to launch the Unity MCP Server.
- **Why it matters**: if uv isn't installed or on PATH, Cursor/Windsurf/VSCode can't start the server; the Unity MCP window will show "**uv Not Found**" until fixed.
- **Detection/override**: the Unity MCP window auto-detects uv in common locations and PATH; if not found, use "Choose UV Install Location" to  navigate to your `uv` installation and save its path.

You need Python 3.12+ and the `uv` package manager for the Unity MCP Server to run.

**Verify**

```bash
python3 --version   # should be 3.12+
uv --version        # should print a version like "uv 0.x"
```

**Install Python**

**macOS:**

```bash
# Option A: Official installer (recommended)
# Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Option B: Homebrew
brew install python@3.12
```

**Windows:**

```powershell
# Official installer (recommended)
# Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
```

**💡 Windows Tip: Consider using WSL** (see [WSL Alternative section](#wsl-alternative-for-windows-users) below)

**Install uv**

**macOS/Linux/WSL:**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# or Homebrew on macOS
brew install uv
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
# or
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv -e
```

**Common uv locations**

- **macOS:** `/opt/homebrew/bin/uv`, `/usr/local/bin/uv`, `~/.local/bin/uv`
- **Linux:** `/usr/local/bin/uv`, `/usr/bin/uv`, `~/.local/bin/uv`
- **Windows:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Programs/Python/Python3xx/Scripts/uv.exe`

**Unity MCP window behavior (Cursor/Windsurf)**

- If uv isn't found, you'll see a red status "uv Not Found" and a hint line "Make sure uv is installed! [CLICK]".
- Use "Choose UV Install Location" to browse to the uv binary. This saves the path and reconfigures automatically.
- On macOS, Unity launched from Finder may not inherit your PATH. Setting the uv location here is the easiest fix.

**Notes and gotchas**

- macOS GUI apps don't inherit your shell startup files; PATH may differ from Terminal. Set uv via the MCP window to avoid PATH issues.
- Windows vs WSL: if you installed uv inside WSL only, Windows-native Unity can't see it. Install uv on Windows, or use the MCP window to point to a Windows uv.exe.
- Custom locations: if you installed uv somewhere non-standard, the picker path is stored in `UnityMCP.UvPath` and persists across sessions.

**What the "Repair Python Env" button does**

- Deletes the server's `.venv` and `.python-version` (if present)
- Runs `uv sync` in the Unity MCP Server `src` directory to rebuild a clean environment
- Useful after Python upgrades or missing modules

**Where is the Unity MCP Server installed?**

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/UnityMCP/UnityMcpServer/src` (or `~/Library/AppSupport/UnityMCP/UnityMcpServer/src` via symlink)
- **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/UnityMCP/UnityMcpServer/src`
- **Linux:** `~/.local/share/UnityMCP/UnityMcpServer/src`

**Manual repair/run (optional)**

```bash
cd <UnityMcpServer/src>
uv sync
uv run server.py
```

### WSL Alternative for Windows Users

**💡 Recommended for Windows users experiencing PATH or uv.exe issues**

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) can completely avoid Windows-specific PATH problems and provides a cleaner Python environment.

**When to use WSL:**
- You're having trouble with multiple `uv.exe` locations on Windows
- PATH issues with Cursor, VSCode, or Windsurf
- You prefer Linux-style package management
- You want a more stable development environment

**WSL + HTTP Mode Setup (Easiest):**

1. **Install WSL2** (if not already installed):
   ```powershell
   # In Windows PowerShell (Administrator)
   wsl --install
   # Restart your computer
   ```

2. **Inside WSL, install Python and uv**:
   ```bash
   # Update package list
   sudo apt update
   
   # Install Python 3.12+
   sudo apt install python3.12 python3-pip
   
   # Install uv
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

3. **In WSL, run the MCP server via HTTP**:
   ```bash
   # Install the server
   uvx --from mcpforunityserver mcp-for-unity --transport http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
   ```

4. **In Unity (Windows)**: 
   - `Window > MCP for Unity`
   - Select **HTTP (Local)** as transport mode
   - Server URL: `http://localhost:8080/mcp`
   - Configure your MCP client to use `http://localhost:8080/mcp`

**Why this works:**
- The HTTP server in WSL is accessible from Windows via `localhost`
- Unity running in Windows can connect to the WSL server seamlessly  
- No need to deal with Windows PATH complexity or multiple `uv.exe` locations
- WSL provides a stable Linux environment for Python development

**WSL + stdio mode** (advanced):
- If you need stdio mode with WSL, you can install uv in WSL and reference the WSL path in your config
- However, this is more complex and **HTTP mode is recommended**

**Troubleshooting WSL:**
- Ensure WSL2 is installed: `wsl --status`
- Check WSL version: `wsl -l -v` (should show version 2)
- If server isn't accessible from Windows, check Windows Firewall settings
- WSL networking issues: restart WSL with `wsl --shutdown` then reopen
