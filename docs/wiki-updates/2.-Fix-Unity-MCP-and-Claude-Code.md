### Install/Repair Claude Code

You need the Claude Code CLI (`claude`) available on your system.

**🚨Advisory🚨**: If you change from `http` to `stdio` mode in the MCP for Unity Window, you'll need to **restart claude code** for it to pick up the change.

**💡 v8+ Recommendation:** Consider using **HTTP mode** instead of stdio mode for simpler setup. With HTTP mode:
- No need to have `claude` on PATH
- Unity MCP window starts the server; Claude Code connects via `http://localhost:8080/mcp`
- Avoids PATH issues especially on macOS and Windows

**If you need stdio mode**, install Claude Code CLI using one of the methods below:

**Recommended (native installers)**

**macOS/Linux/WSL:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
claude doctor
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
claude doctor
```

**Alternative: npm via NVM (installs under ~/.nvm)**

```bash
# Install/select a Node version
nvm install v21.7.1
nvm use v21.7.1

# Install Claude Code CLI into this Node's global prefix
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Verify it's under NVM
which claude
claude --version
```

**Alternative: npm with system/Homebrew Node**

```bash
# If you don't have Node yet (macOS):
brew install node

# Install Claude Code CLI globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Verify it's on PATH (typical: /opt/homebrew/bin/claude or /usr/local/bin/claude)
which claude
claude --version
```

**Note:** On macOS, Unity launched from Finder/Hub may not inherit your shell PATH.
If `claude` isn't found, either launch Hub from Terminal (so PATH propagates) or
use the Unity MCP window's "Choose Claude Install Location" to set the absolute path.

**Alternative: Use HTTP Mode (v8+)**

Instead of dealing with PATH issues, you can use HTTP mode:

1. In Unity: `Window > MCP for Unity`
2. Select **HTTP (Local)** as transport mode
3. Click **Start Server**
4. In Claude Code settings, configure:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "unityMCP": {
         "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

This bypasses the need for `claude` on PATH entirely. The server runs independently and Claude Code connects via HTTP.
