# A few common problems getting UnityMCP Clients configured

### Windows: Use WSL to Avoid PATH and uv.exe Issues

**💡 Top recommendation for Windows users**

If you're experiencing PATH problems, multiple `uv.exe` locations, or configuration issues on Windows, consider using **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** with HTTP mode instead.

**Why WSL helps:**
- Eliminates Windows PATH complexity
- Avoids issues with multiple `uv.exe` installations
- Provides a stable Linux environment
- Works seamlessly with Unity on Windows via HTTP mode

**Quick setup:** See the detailed [WSL Alternative section in the Cursor/VSCode/Windsurf guide](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/wiki/1.-Fix-Unity-MCP-and-Cursor,-VSCode,-Windsurf,-Rider#wsl-alternative-for-windows-users).

### macOS: Claude CLI fails to start (dyld ICU library not loaded)

- Symptoms
  - Unity MCP error: “Failed to start Claude CLI. dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/libicui18n.71.dylib …”
  - Running `claude` in Terminal fails with missing `libicui18n.xx.dylib`.

- Cause
  - Homebrew Node (or the `claude` binary) was linked against an ICU version that’s no longer installed; dyld can’t find that dylib.

- Fix options (pick one)
  - Reinstall Homebrew Node (relinks to current ICU), then reinstall CLI:
    ```bash
    brew update
    brew reinstall node
    npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
    npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
    ```
  - Use NVM Node (avoids Homebrew ICU churn):
    ```bash
    nvm install --lts
    nvm use --lts
    npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
    # Unity MCP → Claude Code → Choose Claude Location → ~/.nvm/versions/node/<ver>/bin/claude
    ```
  - Use the native installer (puts claude in a stable path):
    ```bash
    # macOS/Linux
    curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
    # Unity MCP → Claude Code → Choose Claude Location → /opt/homebrew/bin/claude or ~/.local/bin/claude
    ```

- After fixing
  - In Unity MCP (Claude Code), click “Choose Claude Location” and select the working `claude` binary, then Register again.

### FAQ (Claude Code)

- Q: Unity can’t find `claude` even though Terminal can.
  - A: macOS apps launched from Finder/Hub don’t inherit your shell PATH. In the Unity MCP window, click “Choose Claude Location” and select the absolute path (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude` or `~/.nvm/versions/node/<ver>/bin/claude`).

- Q: I installed via NVM; where is `claude`?
  - A: Typically `~/.nvm/versions/node/<ver>/bin/claude`. Our UI also scans NVM versions and you can browse to it via “Choose Claude Location”.

- Q: The Register button says “Claude Not Found”.
  - A: Install the CLI or set the path. Click the orange “[HELP]” link in the Unity MCP window for step‑by‑step install instructions, then choose the binary location.

### FAQ (VSCode)
- Q: When I first set up and start the Unity MCP server in VSCode, I get a failed response that says `Canceled: Canceled` [see image below]
  - A: Start a new chat, the bad chat didn't 'take' the MCP server configuration.

### FAQ (Windows / WSL)

- Q: Should I install Python/uv in Windows or WSL?
  - A: **For v8+, use HTTP mode** and you can choose either:
    - **Recommended:** Install in WSL and run HTTP server there (`uvx --from mcpforunityserver mcp-for-unity --transport http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`)
    - Windows native: Install in Windows but be prepared for PATH issues
    - **Best:** Just use HTTP mode without needing Python/uv at all (server bundled with plugin)

- Q: I installed uv in WSL but Windows Unity can't find it
  - A: Don't use stdio mode across Windows/WSL boundary. Instead:
    1. Run the MCP server in WSL using HTTP mode: `uvx --from mcpforunityserver mcp-for-unity --transport http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`
    2. In Unity (Windows), use `http://localhost:8080/mcp` as the server URL
    3. Configure your MCP client (Cursor/VSCode) to use the same HTTP URL

- Q: My Windows PATH has multiple uv.exe locations causing problems
  - A: Use WSL with HTTP mode to bypass this entirely, OR manually select the stable path `C:\Users\<YOU>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Links\uv.exe` in Unity MCP window. See the [Cursor Help guide](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp/blob/main/docs/guides/CURSOR_HELP.md) for details.

- Q: Can I use WSL with stdio mode?
  - A: While technically possible, it's complex and not recommended. **Use HTTP mode** which works seamlessly between WSL and Windows.

### FAQ (General)

- Q: What's the difference between HTTP and stdio mode?
  - A: 
    - **HTTP mode (v8+, recommended)**: Server runs as standalone HTTP service, simpler setup, works across environments
    - **stdio mode (legacy)**: Server runs as subprocess of MCP client, requires Python/uv on client's PATH
    - **For most users:** HTTP mode is simpler and more reliable

- Q: Do I need Python and uv installed?
  - A: **For v8+ with HTTP mode**: Not required for basic usage (server can be bundled or run remotely)
  - **For stdio mode**: Yes, Python 3.10+ and uv are required
  - **Recommended**: Use HTTP mode to avoid installation complexity
