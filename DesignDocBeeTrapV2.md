## **Section 1: Comparative Framework of Embodied Analogies**

| Structural Component | Beehive Analogy Representation (Task1)AK | Redesigned Sprinkler Analogy Representation (Task 2\) | New Analogy Task 3\)  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **User** | **Bee:** The user embodies a bee, navigating the garden with first-person flight controls. | **Gardener:** The user embodies a gardener, equipped with a handheld tool and a backpack tank, navigating the garden. SAME |  |
| **Content Item** | **Flower:** 3D models of flowers with varying attributes (color, petal shape, size). | **Data Plant:** Stylized, futuristic plant models that progress through life stages (seed, sprout, bloom, wilt). SAME |  |
| **User Profile** | **Beehive:** A central 3D model of a beehive that physically moves within the garden space. Makes the user profile more tangible and observable. | **Profile Gauge: A gauge** on the user's wrist with a visible fluid level and color. The fluid's color changes based on the plants watered. **S**AME |  |
| **User Interaction** | **Pollination:** The user aims at a specific flower and presses a controller button, triggering a visual/audio effect. | **Targeted Watering:** A discrete, targeted action where the user aims the sprinkler and fires a focused water stream at a specific plant. **SAME** |  |
| **Profile Update** | **Beehive Movement:** The beehive's position visibly drifts toward the location of pollinated flowers, making the profile update a spatial change. | **Tank Color Change:** The fluid in the Profile Tank changes color to a weighted average of the colors of the watered plants, providing immediate visual feedback. **SAME** |  |
| **Candidate Generation** | **Pollen Circle:** A visible, circular boundary on the ground centered on the beehive, defining which flowers are close enough to be considered. | The water range stream has a maximum effective distance. Only plants within this range can be interacted with. |  |
| **SimilarityalrityDiversity vs. diversity ranking** | **Close vs sparse pollen** | Water pattern: close to center or sparse out |  |
| **Similarity/Diversity-Based Ranking** | **Bud Growth:** Flower buds closest to the beehive grow into full flowers first, representing ranking through physical proximity. | **Proximity-Based Growth:** Plants with a color attribute most similar to the Profile Tank's fluid color grow faster, representing ranking through attribute similarity. SAME |  |
| **Feedback Loop** | **Garden Dynamics:** pollinating flowers moves the beehive, which causes similar flowers to grow nearby, encouraging further similar pollination. | **Garden Cultivation:** Watering plants of a certain color changes the tank's color, which in turn accelerates the growth of other plants of that same color, encouraging further specialized watering. SAME |  |
