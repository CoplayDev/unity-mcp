## Development Deployment Scripts

These deployment scripts help you quickly test changes to MCP for Unity core code.

## Scripts

### `deploy-dev.bat`
Deploys your development code to the actual installation locations for testing.

**What it does:**
1. Backs up original files to a timestamped folder
2. Copies Unity Bridge code to Unity's package cache
3. Copies Python Server code to the MCP installation folder

**Usage:**
1. Run `deploy-dev.bat`
2. Enter Unity package cache path (example provided)
3. Enter server path (or use default: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\UnityMCP\UnityMcpServer\src`)
4. Enter backup location (or use default: `%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\unity-mcp-backup`)

**Note:** Dev deploy skips `.venv`, `__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.git`; reduces churn and avoids copying virtualenvs.

### `restore-dev.bat`
Restores original files from backup.

**What it does:**
1. Lists available backups with timestamps
2. Allows you to select which backup to restore
3. Restores both Unity Bridge and Python Server files

## Finding Unity Package Cache Path

Unity stores Git packages under a version-or-hash folder. Expect something like:
```
X:\UnityProject\Library\PackageCache\com.coplaydev.unity-mcp@<version-or-hash>
```
Example (hash):
```
X:\UnityProject\Library\PackageCache\com.coplaydev.unity-mcp@272123cfd97e

```

To find it reliably:
1. Open Unity Package Manager
2. Select "MCP for Unity" package
3. Right click the package and choose "Show in Explorer"
4. That opens the exact cache folder Unity is using for your project

Note: In recent builds, the Python server sources are also bundled inside the package under `UnityMcpServer~/src`. This is handy for local testing or pointing MCP clients directly at the packaged server.

## Workflow

1. **Make changes** to your source code in this directory
2. **Deploy** using `deploy-dev.bat`
3. **Test** in Unity (restart Unity Editor first)
4. **Iterate** - repeat steps 1-3 as needed
5. **Restore** original files when done using `restore-dev.bat`


## Switching MCP package sources quickly

Use `mcp_source.py` to quickly switch between different MCP for Unity package sources:

**Usage:**
```bash
python mcp_source.py [--manifest /path/to/manifest.json] [--repo /path/to/unity-mcp] [--choice 1|2|3]
```

**Options:**
- **1** Upstream main (CoplayDev/unity-mcp)
- **2** Remote current branch (origin + branch)
- **3** Local workspace (file: UnityMcpBridge)

After switching, open Package Manager and Refresh to re-resolve packages.


## Troubleshooting

### "Path not found" errors running the .bat file
- Verify Unity package cache path is correct
- Check that MCP for Unity package is actually installed
- Ensure server is installed via MCP client

### "Permission denied" errors
- Run cmd as Administrator
- Close Unity Editor before deploying
- Close any MCP clients before deploying

### "Backup not found" errors
- Run `deploy-dev.bat` first to create initial backup
- Check backup directory permissions
- Verify backup directory path is correct

### Windows uv path issues
- On Windows, when testing GUI clients, prefer the WinGet Links `uv.exe`; if multiple `uv.exe` exist, use "Choose `uv` Install Location" to pin the Links shim.
