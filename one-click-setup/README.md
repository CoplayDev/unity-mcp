## User Experience

**Before:** Complex multi-step setup with Git dependencies
**After:** Single file execution with automatic environment setup

## Benefits for Public Distribution

- **Eliminates setup friction** - Users can start immediately
- **No technical knowledge required** - Just double-click and go
- **Works offline** - No internet required after initial Python install
- **Self-contained** - Everything included in project download
- **Clear troubleshooting** - Built-in validation and error guidance

## Compatibility

- **Windows** - Primary platform (batch file)
- **WSL/Linux** - Compatible with network IP detection
- **Unity 6000.0.37f1+** - Tested and verified
- **Python 3.12+** - Auto-detected and validated

## Technical Implementation

The Universal Launcher:
1. **Validates Environment** - Checks Unity, Python, components
2. **Creates Virtual Environment** - Isolated Python environment
3. **Installs Dependencies** - From bundled requirements.txt
4. **Starts Combined Services** - Unity MCP Server + Claude Code Bridge
5. **Manages Lifecycle** - Graceful startup/shutdown of both services

## Contribution

This one-click setup improves Unity MCP accessibility by:
- Reducing setup time from ~30 minutes to ~30 seconds
- Eliminating common Git-related setup failures
- Providing better error messages and guidance
- Making Unity MCP suitable for public project distribution
